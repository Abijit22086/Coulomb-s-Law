# Coulomb’s Law: Electrostatic Force in Modern Electronic Systems

## 1. Introduction
Electric charge forms the backbone of all modern electronics — from touchscreens and sensors to high-voltage power systems. Whenever two charges exist near each other, they exert an electrostatic force governed by **Coulomb’s Law**.

This law influences:
- Charge distribution  
- Electric field generation  
- Capacitor operation  
- Dielectric breakdown  
- Semiconductor and conductor behavior  

Understanding Coulomb’s Law helps engineers design safe, efficient, and reliable electronic systems.

## 2. System Overview: Electrostatic Force Between Charges
Systems containing static electric charge follow Coulomb’s Law. This applies to:

- Capacitor plates storing charge  
- Touchscreen sensor grids  
- High-voltage conductors and insulation  
- Semiconductor fabrication processes  
- PCB traces influenced by charge buildup  

The core formula:

F = k * (Q1 * Q2) / r^2


Where:
- `F` → Force between charges  
- `Q1`, `Q2` → Charge magnitudes  
- `r` → Distance between charges

F_net = Σ Fi

### Applications:
- IC electrostatic modeling  
- Capacitor field calculations  
- Multi-electrode sensors  
- Plasma systems & ion propulsion

## 6. Work, Energy & Potential

Electric potential due to a charge:

V = k * (Q / r)

### Importance:
- Determines how much energy a capacitor can store  
- Defines safe distances in power electronics  
- Sets voltage distribution across conductors  
- Guides high-voltage design practices  

Energy stored in a capacitor:

U = (1/2) * C * V^2

1. A finger introduces a small charge.  
2. This disturbs the electric field pattern on the sensor grid.  
3. The device detects these changes in capacitance.  
4. Touch coordinates are processed instantly.
